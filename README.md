# rel
Relativity or Relativism

# Dhyāna (ध्यान) 
The given koan, or caveat:

```
Focus on that which is not comparable to any,
Neither via similarity,
Nor via contrast. 
```

# Cognition (संज्ञान)
The verses presented here about meditating, or focusing on that which may simultaneously and paradoxically, exist, as well as, not exist. Ultimately, the act of focusing on that type of a thing that, may merely turn into a realization about realizing things, or a cognition about human cognition along with its limitations, and about its reliance on "relativism." The concept of "relation", or "relative" is at the foundation of our thoughts, and thereby of our behaviours. It is also the foundation of our contemplated, and actual universe, in the form of "relativity."  

More importantly, if all aspects of our capacity to think and feel, are guaranteed to be relative, what are they relative to? They are relative to an absolute - an absolute that **cannot** be accurately encapsulated, described, or transmitted using any type of a message, in any kind of a medium within, in any possible mode of communication.

Upon experiencing the limitations of human cognition, and of communication, by contemplating about the given "koan", or caveat, one can then proceed to better frame questions that are more amenable to answering and more conveniently communicated as an answer to worthwhile questions. Insipid questions like, "who is God?" or "what is God?" and utterly idiotic questions like, "why is God?" can thus be avoided. 

In contemplating about that which is not comparable to any, neither via similarity or contrast, we can arrive at the precipice, of the meaning of *[Allāhu as-Samad](https://quran.com/112/2)*. And only at the precipice, because the thorough awareness of *as-Samad* would cause the cognizer to pale into annihilation within *al-Ikhlas* (The Purity) via peace, and love. 

This form of [praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process)) leads to a [gnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosis) at the intersection of [cataphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataphatic_theology) and [apophatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology) theology, where neither this nor that, can be posited nor denied, about *Allāhu al-Aḥad*. 

Such is the case in as many possible 
  - glyphs, 
  - alphabets, 
  - scripts, 
  - uttered or unuttered speech, 
  - motioned or unrequited gesture, 

that may belong to the realm of communicability, from self-to-self, or self-to-other. And it is as such, because *lam yalid wa lam yụlad, wa lam yakul lahụ kufuwan aḥad.*
