Relativity or Relativism

# Dhyāna (ध्यान) 
```
Focus on that which is not comparable to any,
Neither via similarity,
Nor via contrast. 
```

# Cognition (संज्ञान)
The verses presented here about meditating or focusing on that which may simultaneously and paradoxically exist, as well as not exist, merely alludes to human cognition, its limitations and its reliance on relativism. The concept of "relation" or "relative" is at the foundation of our thoughts and thereby of our behaviours. It is the foundation of our contemplated and actual universe as relativity.  

More importantly, if all aspects of our thought are guaranteed to be relative, what are they relative to? They are relative to an absolute - an absolute that **cannot** be accurately encapsulated, described or transmitted using any type of message in any kind of medium within any existant mode of communication.

Upon experiencing the limitiations of human cognition and communication by contemplating about this simple koan (caveat), one can then proceed to better frame questions that are actually worthy of an answer. Insipid questions like, "who is God?" or "what is God?" and utterly idiotic questions like, "why is God?" can thus be avoided. 

In contemplating that which is not comparable to any, neither via similarity or contrast, we can arrive at the precipice of the meaning of *[Allāhu as-Samad](https://quran.com/112/2)*. Merely the precipice because the thorough awareness of *as-Samad* would cause the cognizer to pale into annihalation within *al-Ikhlas* (The Purity) via peace and love. 

This form of [praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process)) leads to a [gnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosis) at the intersection of [cataphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataphatic_theology) and [apophatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology) theology where neither this or that can be posited nor denied about... *Allāhu al-Aḥad*. 

Such is the case in as many possible 
  - glyphs, 
  - alphabets, 
  - scripts, 
  - uttered or unuttered speech, 
  - motioned or unrequited gesture 

that may belong to the realm of communicability from self-to-self or self-to-other. And it as such because *lam yalid wa lam yụlad, wa lam yakul lahụ kufuwan aḥad.*
